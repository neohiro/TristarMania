# Tristar Mania: Major Update Changelog

This document details the comprehensive changes between the legacy version and the current version (`TristarMania.PY`). This update focuses heavily on visual polish, "juice" (screen shake, particles), and steeper difficulty scaling.

## 🎨 Visual Overhaul & Graphics

 The rendering pipeline has been significantly upgraded to support more complex geometry and particle effects.

### 1. Parallax Background
* **New:** Implemented a `ParallaxStar` class. These stars are fainter and move based on the player's delta movement (`player_dx`, `player_dy`), creating a depth/3D effect relative to the foreground.
* **Old:** Static falling starfield only.

### 2. Procedural Asteroids
* **New:** `SpaceRock` now generates random polygons (7-12 points) with varying radii to create jagged, rock-like shapes. They also feature rotation mechanics and a distinct outline.
* **Old:** Simple grey circles drawn using `pygame.draw.circle`.

### 3. Laser Effects
* **New:** Lasers are now rendered as rotated surfaces to match their travel direction. They include a "glow" effect (a larger, translucent circle centered on the laser head).
* **Old:** Simple, non-rotated rectangles.

### 4. Boss Design (3D Effect)
* **New:** The Boss is no longer a flat square. It is drawn using multiple polygons to create a "beveled" 3D pyramid look with shading (light top, dark bottom). It features a pulsating red "core" eye in the center.
* **Old:** A solid, flat red square (`ENEMY_COLOR`).

### 5. Engine Trails
* **New:** Added `TrailParticle` class. The player's ship now emits cyan particles from the rear when moving forward, which fade out over time.
* **Old:** No engine trails implemented.

## 🎮 Gameplay & AI Changes

### Boss AI & Difficulty
* **Movement Logic:** The Boss now utilizes a timer to switch behaviors between **tracking the player** (60% chance) and **moving to a random point** in the upper screen (40% chance). Previously, it only tracked the player directly.
* **Dual Bosses:** At **Level 8+**, two bosses will now spawn simultaneously. To balance this, the HP multiplier for bosses was reduced from `2.0` to `1.2` when in dual mode.

### Screen Shake
* **Implementation:** The game now renders to a temporary `display_surface` instead of directly to the screen. This allows the entire game world to be offset by random X/Y values (`shake_offset`) during high-impact events (taking damage, destroying a boss).

### Neutral Ships
* **Spawning:** Neutral ships now spawn exclusively at the screen edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) and fly across the screen.
* **Old Behavior:** Spawned at random coordinates and wrapped around screen edges.

### Invulnerability Feedback
* **New:** The Lifebar UI now flashes white and red when the player is down to **1 Life**.

## ⚙️ System & Quality of Life

### Resolution & Display
* **4K Support:** Added `(3840, 2160)` to the resolution list.
* **Scaling:** Implemented `pygame.SCALED` flag. This ensures the window contents scale up properly on high-DPI monitors or when fullscreen is active on lower resolutions.

### Screenshots
* **New Feature:** Pressing `F12` or `PRINTSCREEN` saves a timestamped PNG of the current frame to the user's `Pictures/TristarMania` folder.
    * *Dependencies:* Added `import os` and `from datetime import datetime`.

## ⚖️ Balance & Progression

### Leveling Formula
The difficulty curve has been steepened significantly.

* **Old Formula:**
    ```python
    score_needed = Level * (475 + 25 * Level)
    ```
* **New Formula:**
    ```python
    score_needed = Level * (600 + 100 * Level)
    ```

### Level Up Timer
* The text popup for "LEVEL UP" is now faster, lasting **60 frames** (1 second) instead of the previous implicit duration.
